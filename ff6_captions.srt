1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,380
This is a Tool-Assisted Speedrun of Final Fantasy 6 (US) in 3:11:33.46 by Keylie and Kadmony

2
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,480
More information on TASVideos.org

3
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,960
Menu #1: Battle Speed 6, Message Speed 1, Cursor Memory, Magic Order 2, Terra on last slot

4
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,060
Terra was placed on last slot because during preemptives/side attacks, the lowest character acts first

5
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,320
We need Terra to earn as much XP as possible so we made Wedge and Vicks escape

6
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,315
We skipped two fights with this detour

7
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,180
This fight is a forced pincer attack

8
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,100
We cannot escape while the Lobo is alive

9
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,720
Terra got level 4

10
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:57,060
It would be too long to make Wedge and Vicks escape, because we would have to kill the Vomammoth first

11
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,080
Vicks and Wedge got level 2

12
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,120
Getting a preemptive here wouldn't save time

13
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,720
You can get this first fight or not depending on how your emulator fills uninitialised RAM

14
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:45,435
We need to win this fight for experience

15
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,240
Terra got level 5

16
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,880
Boss: Whelk. Head is 1600 HP, Shell is 50000 HP

17
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,100
We stay in this menu to freeze the enemy ATB         (wait trick)

18
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,420
Using the wait trick and good startup ATB, it is possible to kill Whelk before it goes in its shell

19
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,880
Having no command window opened at the end of a fight saves a bit of time

20
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,380
Renaming characters to one letter saves several minutes overall

21
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,300
We switch to the party containing Mog, as he's the strongest character

22
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,320
We removed the Mithril Pike and the Mithril Shield from Mog, they will be useful later

23
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,560
Because Terra is level 5, Locks joins at level 7

24
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,780
We wait here a few seconds for luck manipulation

25
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,540
This is forced Back attack

26
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,000
As our average level is 6, Edgar joins at level 8

27
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,340
We will fight the next three battles for XP and money

28
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,680
Terra got level 6

29
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,380
Shopping #1: Buy 3 Sprint Shoes and 1 Goggles

30
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,760
Menu #2: Put Message Speed on 2 and equip Terra with a Sprint Shoes

31
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,800
Walking on light green tiles with a dark green corner cannot trigger a random encounter

32
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,420
Thanks to Message Speed 2, we can escape those battles quickly

33
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:41,340
We swap the weapon and shield to add lag frames, to get a faster preemptive on the next fight

34
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,180
The incoming boss will feature the first Desperation Attack (DA)

35
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,760
When a character with low HP (< 1/8 max HP) attacks an enemy, he has 1 in 16 chance to trigger a DA

36
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,600
DAs are magical unblockable attacks that ignore defense

37
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,020
However, DAs are unlocked about 25 seconds after the beginning of the fight

38
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,440
Boss: Vargas (11600 HP), Ipooh (360 HP)

39
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:29,440
Locke is targeting with Steal to freeze Vargas ATB

40
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,840
Sabin cutscene is triggered after 720 HP of damage

41
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,980
With a good startup ATB for Sabin and the previous ATB trick, it is possible to cast Pummel before Vargas

42
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,600
Our average level is 7 so Sabin joins at level 9

43
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,800
The time spend here and everywhere with moving NPCs increases a RNG counter

44
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,380
This counter is used amongst other things to determine how many fights will happen on the Lete River

45
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,220
Because we waited for 3 seconds in Figaro, we don't have to wait here to get the minimum number of fights

46
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,600
The Figaro submerge cutscene is where this counter is increasing the fastest

47
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,540
Menu #3: Sabin gets Sprint Shoes, Edgar gets Genji Glove, Config Battle Speed 1

48
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,080
We set Battle Speed 1 here so that Ultros second attack will happen before the DA is unlocked

49
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,240
We have to set Battle Speed 1 for the fight against Leader anyway

50
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,400
We equip the Mithril Shield on Terra so she can survive Ultros Tentacule

51
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,240
The first two fights were mandatory, the next ones are random

52
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,860
Thanks to the random manipulation, we won't have any

53
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,020
We use quick escapes to increase the RNG counter

54
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,760
So we can get criticals earlier

55
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,640
Ultros will always attack Terra, so she will do the DA in this fight

56
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,980
We unequip the Mithril Shield for a later use

57
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:40,140
We started with Locke scenario because starting with Terra would trigger an extra fight on the river

58
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,680
Also, we need the Elixir from Locke scenario during Sabin scenario

59
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,860
Menu #4: Locke equips the Sprint Shoes

60
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,240
We enter the house to reset the position of the guard

61
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,780
Menu #5: Nothing

62
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,480
By entering and exiting the menu, it is possible to clip through the guard, saving about 3 minutes

63
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,260
There is a Thunder Rod in this cave that can kill instantly the next boss, but it is too long to take

64
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,220
Menu #6: Locke unequips the Sprint Shoes

65
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,280
We paused a few frames on the last dialogue to manipulate the river for Terra scenario

66
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,120
We are supposed to have Celes here, so she's still talking but does not have a name

67
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,160
Boss: TunnelArmr (1300HP)

68
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,500
We used the "Can't run away!!" message to delay the boss attack

69
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:30,080
Shadow can join the party here, but it is not worth taking him

70
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,860
Mainly because he will slow down all the escapes

71
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:32,320
Menu #7: Cyan equips Sprint Shoes

72
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,220
We don't have time to cast Retort without a preemptive

73
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,340
The common drop (Black Belt) will be useful very soon

74
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,680
Menu #8: Sabin equips Black Belt, Message Speed 1

75
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,580
It is not possible to escape a single Ghost quickly with a preemptive

76
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:06,500
Same as single Ghosts, this is the fastest way to escape a single Bomb

77
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:07,480
Earrings (like Hero Ring) raises by a factor of 5/4 every magical attacks (including DAs!)

78
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,820
If equipped with two Earrings/Hero Ring, it raises by a factor of 3/2 every magical attacks

79
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,520
Three single Bomb fights is really bad luck

80
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,940
We lost about one second for each one of those fights

81
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,640
Boss: GhostTrain (1900 HP)

82
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:15,320
We could also use a Fenix Down, but the Elixir has a faster animation

83
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,400
We have to wait for a certain time here

84
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,880
We have to wait for about one minute before the boss Rizopas can appear

85
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:19,200
Boss: Rizopas (775 HP)

86
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,780
The light green no-encounter tiles don't work here

87
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,560
This fight is unescapable :(

88
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:13,400
We couldn't manipulate a no-drop fight

89
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,260
Shopping #2: Buy a Dried Meat

90
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:08,260
As opposed to normally, we can manipulate the enemy formation here

91
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:26,160
We want formations with at least 3 enemies to be able to escape quickly

92
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,000
Sabin equips the Mithril Shield

93
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:07,720
Because we skipped Celes, she is replaced with Kutan, a Moggle that appeared at the beginning of the game

94
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,440
This is because Celes character slot was previously occupied by Kutan

95
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,820
Kutan cannot equip weapons, armors, relics or Espers

96
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:21,420
It is possible to disable the trigger of the fights against those guards

97
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:29,780
By pressing X (menu) followed by Y (party switch), the game will be kept at an "opening menu" state

98
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,040
Guards won't trigger the fight in that state

99
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,100
Menu #9: Battle Speed 6, Sabin replaces Black Belt with Earrings

100
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:47,560
Boss: Kefka (3000 HP)

101
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,280
The dropped Peace Ring will be useful for money

102
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,340
Solo Sabin will be enough for Zozo

103
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:28,420
Every extra character in the team makes the escapes longer by about half a second

104
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:51,840
We deliberately ignore one no-encounter tile so that the next fight will trigger further from the desert

105
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:04,700
A danger counter increases at each step by a constant depending roughly on the type of field

106
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:12,840
Triggering the last fight closer to the desert would have updated that constant to the desert-type (high)

107
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,380
In the end, we would have triggered an extra battle on the way

108
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:57,080
The save/reset here has multiple purposes:

109
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:07,840
First, it reset all the encounter constants to other values, saving two fights overall

110
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:22,580
Second, we will have to farm a specific fight later in the game, and this fight will trigger in one step

111
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:33,069
Third, we will run across Flan in the Magitek factory, because we need to steal something from them

112
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:38,800
Taking the Hero Ring here

113
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:38,160
Preemptives here are very rare, we had to do many weird things in battle to manipulate them

114
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:56,820
Menu #10: Sabin replaces Sprint Shoes with Hero Ring

115
01:23:59,780 --> 01:24:02,480
Boss: Dadaluma (3270 HP)

116
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:41,660
Moving up the Sprint Shoes so the next menu is faster

117
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:49,140
Menu #11: Sabin replaces Hero Ring with Sprint Shoes

118
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:59,580
Taking the RunningShoes saves time here and there, more in total than the 3 seconds to take them

119
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:09,240
The previous menu could be avoided with a second character, but not worthy because of slower escapes

120
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:36,340
The major time-saver of this run is by the use of the sketch glitch with Relm's sketch command

121
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:43,760
This glitch requires us to learn at least 10 specific magics

122
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:54,100
This is why we will take Stray and Siren here

123
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,420
Stray teaches Muddle and Imp for 20 Magic Points

124
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:12,440
Siren teaches Sleep and Slow for 15 Magic Points

125
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:30,580
We need Sabin and Edgar for the Magitek Factory

126
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:06,420
Menu #12: Locke gets Sprint Shoes and RunningShoes, Edgar gets Earrings and Hero Ring, Locks gets Stray

127
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:32,280
You can alter the behavior of the rats by going into the menu

128
01:44:32,980 --> 01:44:35,740
Boss: Ultros (2550 HP)

129
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:09,900
Edgar DA has the fastest animation, so we choose him to kill the boss everytime it is possible

130
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:24,780
Shopping #3: Sell Peace Ring, buy 2 Warp Stone and 5 Smoke Bomb

131
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:41,200
Kutan now has the Celes sprite, but is otherwise as useless as before

132
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:09,680
Boss: Ifrit (3300 HP) and Shiva (3000 HP)

133
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:32,300
Ifrit is replaced with Shiva after 5 physical attacks

134
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:40,980
We can escape the fight during that switch, and the game goes on as if we won the fight

135
01:52:55,300 --> 01:53:02,000
We stole a Magicite from a Flan, an item that casts a random Esper (excluding Odin and Raiden)

136
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:23,500
We let Kutan die on purpose so that escapes are faster

137
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:45,100
We also stole a Flash (rare steal), that will be very useful during the Minecart escape

138
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:08,660
Boss: Number 024 (4777 HP)

139
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:14,640
We need the Rune Edge for money

140
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:42,100
One DA is not enough for this boss

141
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,900
We will also sell the drop of this boss (Blizzard)

142
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:46,600
Menu #13: Order the party as Sabin, Locke and Edgar

143
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:54,240
The formation of the 5 next fights depends on which character is the leader

144
01:57:56,160 --> 01:58:00,860
Having Sabin as the leader will give the fastest fights

145
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:35,420
Having Edgar at the bottom allows him to cast Flash quickly

146
01:58:58,940 --> 01:59:02,660
Edgar got level 9 and Locke level 8

147
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:58,320
Sabin got level 10

148
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:10,000
Boss: Number 128 (3276 HP), Left Blade (700 HP) and RightBlade (400 HP)

149
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:45,520
We stole the Tempest (rare steal) for money and the Tincture (rare steal) for the endgame

150
02:00:52,340 --> 02:00:54,320
Locke learns Muddle

151
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:18,300
Boss: Crane (1800 HP) and Crane (2300 HP)

152
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:34,380
The Smoke Bomb was used to unlock Joker Doom (JD) from Setzer's slot command

153
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:42,260
Joker Doom is an instant-death attack to all targets, which include some bosses

154
02:02:43,760 --> 02:02:47,300
During a standard play, a Smoke Bomb would not work

155
02:02:49,260 --> 02:02:56,860
The slots of Setzer are rigged, you have to set a hidden counter to one of several values to unlock JD

156
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:04,860
This counter starts at zero and is increased during several battle animations by a specific value

157
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:12,800
The Smoke Bomb raises this counter by 16 times the number of characters, in this case 64

158
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:18,840
But 64 does not unlock the Joker Doom

159
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:28,020
However, this counter does not increase instantly, but goes by a lot of values between 0 and 64

160
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:36,340
If we confirm the first reel of the slots when the counter is set as 16, the Joker Doom will be possible

161
02:08:36,900 --> 02:08:42,180
Terra is back in the team, her level was set again to the average level, which is 9

162
02:08:45,740 --> 02:08:49,440
Menu #14: Terra gets Shoat, Locke gets Siren 

163
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:55,180
We make a little detour to the Triangle Island

164
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:12,880
The Ragnarok Esper morphs an enemy into an item, which ends the fight

165
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:19,100
Locke learns Sleep

166
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:25,500
Thanks to the save/reset, we ran across this Intangir (about 1 in 3 chance) after one step

167
02:09:27,420 --> 02:09:34,840
Fighting this Intangir is the fastest way to learn 10 Magic Points, which is needed to learn the required spells

168
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:41,140
Fighting him now is useful to unlock Terra's Morph command for Thamasa

169
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:48,840
Terra's Morph command is unlocked after earning at least 8 Magic Points

170
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:58,860
The other reason to fight the Intangir now is that we will be able to trigger the sketch glitch as soon as Relm joins

171
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:51,960
By triggering a fight here, the bridges will switch instantly to the other configuration, saving about 3 seconds

172
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:28,640
The developers disabled L+R to escape the fight, but didn't bother disabling the Smoke Bomb

173
02:14:30,620 --> 02:14:37,720
The Warp Stone is also possible to escape fights, but it is more expensive and slower for a one-character party

174
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:58,180
Menu #15: We use a Warp Stone

175
02:19:07,780 --> 02:19:13,380
By exiting and entering again, the red guard that would slow us down is gone

176
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:59,340
To get the Charm Bangle, we would need to talk to many soldiers and fight guards during the banquet

177
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:04,860
The Charm Bangle is very useful: it halfs the probability of getting a fight

178
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:11,980
But getting this item costs about 1 minute to take. It is actually not worth it!

179
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:18,260
So we have 4 minutes to wait

180
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:25,680
We order items in advance for the shopping and the sketch glitch

181
02:20:54,280 --> 02:20:57,220
Still 3 minutes to wait

182
02:23:42,320 --> 02:23:44,180
Locke got level 9

183
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:06,140
Menu #16: Terra gets Earrings, Hero Ring and moves to second slot, we use a Warp Stone

184
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:19,480
The move to second slot was to escape this fight faster

185
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:33,200
This second save/reset will save 3 fights until the end of Thamasa

186
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:53,140
Again, this is faster than getting a preemptive

187
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:08,960
Shopping #4: Sell Rune Edge, Blizzard and Tempest; buy 2 Fire Rods and 3 Ice Rods

188
02:38:03,980 --> 02:38:09,820
We can influence the pattern of Bombs by delaying entering the rooms

189
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:30,760
Boss: FlameEater (8400 HP)

190
02:38:37,180 --> 02:38:41,280
We use the wait trick to stop the Balloons

191
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:55,080
Morphed Terra does twice damage of magical attacks

192
02:38:56,560 --> 02:39:01,960
If the fights ends with Terra's Morph gauge not empty, she will keep the Morph ability

193
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:07,360
We still need Morph, this why we use another wait trick

194
02:39:10,220 --> 02:39:14,000
Terra learns Bio, Locke learns Mute and Slow

195
02:41:31,660 --> 02:41:38,760
For now, we have 8 magics: Locke got Sleep, Slow, Muddle, Imp; Terra got Fire, Cure, Antdot and Bio

196
02:41:41,800 --> 02:41:47,780
Terra needs 4 Magic Points to learn Break and about 2800 XP to learn Drain

197
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:54,000
We will have to farm two more fights

198
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:03,640
After learning these magics, Terra will have Break in the 28th position of her magic list, enabling the sketch glitch

199
02:42:32,920 --> 02:42:37,140
Here is how a slow preemptive escape looks like

200
02:43:06,500 --> 02:43:09,920
Terra got level 12 and learned Drain

201
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:31,280
Terra learns Break

202
02:44:21,360 --> 02:44:28,160
Menu #17: Terra moves to the first slot, Strago gets Phantom and RunningShoes, set Battle Mode on active

203
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:44,800
Boss: Ultros (22000 HP)

204
02:44:56,900 --> 02:45:02,020
Using the combination Muddle/Phantom, we can set the Clear status on Ultros

205
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:09,940
Due to a programming bug, the Clear status overwrite the Death protection

206
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:20,440
Strago DA is different from the other ones, it casts Death on a single target

207
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:28,040
Thanks to this fast kill, we skipped a 90-seconds cutscene with Relm

208
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:34,860
Now that we have Relm, we are ready to trigger the sketch glitch

209
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:42,680
This glitch happens when Relm's Sketch misses and the first character has a specific magic on 28th slot

210
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:49,400
It also depends on the availability of that spell, which can be manipulated with the Imp spell

211
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:19,340
This glitch has the main consequence of overwriting part of your inventory

212
02:46:21,320 --> 02:46:26,800
Thanks to this one, we now have Flame Shields

213
02:46:28,360 --> 02:46:33,520
Also, we managed to equip Goggles in Strago's left hand

214
02:46:34,980 --> 02:46:42,100
By putting the Goggles in a specific slot, the sketch glitch overwrote the item properties but not its type

215
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:50,300
The item was flagged as a weapon, so we could equip it during the fight

216
02:46:52,300 --> 02:46:57,640
Attacking with Goggles leads to a new glitch

217
02:46:59,320 --> 02:47:05,920
If someone attacks with Goggles and another character opens the Magic menu at a precise time

218
02:47:07,320 --> 02:47:12,320
The Magic menu will display the inventory if scrolled up or down

219
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:21,400
If an item is used in this glitched menu, the character will cast the magic which has the same id as the item

220
02:47:23,280 --> 02:47:30,260
The game treats Blitz, SwdTech, Tools, Desperation Attacks, enemy attacks, etc. as magics

221
02:47:31,980 --> 02:47:37,440
So all these can be cast using the Goggles glitch

222
02:47:39,060 --> 02:47:45,620
The only restriction is that the corresponding item must be usable in battle

223
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:52,920
For example, using an Antidote will cast Cyan's desperation attack Back Blade

224
02:47:54,220 --> 02:48:01,480
But we can get around the restriction to usable items thanks to the sketch glitch

225
02:50:31,220 --> 02:50:33,320
Boss: Kefka (5001 HP)

226
02:50:48,860 --> 02:50:54,200
Unfortunately, two Flame Shields barely not killed Kefka

227
02:58:48,980 --> 02:58:52,980
Menu #18: Order the party as: Terra, Strago, Relm, Locke

228
02:58:54,380 --> 02:58:59,640
If Relm has a higher level than the enemy, the Sketch will automatically succeed

229
02:59:01,040 --> 02:59:05,700
That's why we used Muddle to make her miss

230
02:59:13,240 --> 02:59:17,960
Thanks to this Sketch glitch, we got Gem Box and we multiplied Black Belts

231
02:59:22,380 --> 02:59:29,500
Menu #19: Strago gets Gem Box and Black Belt, Relm gets Sprint Shoes, Locke gets RunningShoes, Terra gets Sprint Shoes and Gem Box

232
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:41,900
We first trigger a sketch glitch to make the Black Belt usable

233
02:59:42,760 --> 02:59:46,840
Strago has to equip a buckler to be able to attack with Goggles

234
02:59:53,060 --> 02:59:58,540
The Magic corresponding to Black Belt is Engulf, which targets the enemy by default

235
02:59:59,320 --> 03:00:03,620
That is why we need Muddle to cast Engulf on the party

236
03:00:04,420 --> 03:00:09,960
The Goggles glitch was triggered with the X-Magic command so Terra can cast Engulf twice

237
03:00:18,500 --> 03:00:24,120
To Engulf the remaining two characters, we used the counter-attack

238
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:41,160
Because the whole party was engulfed, we end up inside the Zone Eater

239
03:00:42,700 --> 03:00:46,720
By taking the exit, we are warped to the World of Ruin!

240
03:00:57,520 --> 03:01:03,480
We need a last sketch glitch to equip Moggle Charms and Goggles on 3 characters

241
03:01:04,500 --> 03:01:09,240
The setup here is longer: 4 Tincture then Imp on Terra

242
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:20,700
This glitch caused a lot of lag :(

243
03:01:36,900 --> 03:01:43,000
Now Terra, Locke and Strago have one Moogle Charm and one Goggles equiped

244
03:01:44,660 --> 03:01:47,760
Moogle Charm removes all random encounters

245
03:01:57,060 --> 03:02:05,200
The last sketch glitch also corrupted the character sprites, and is causing a 10-seconds freeze

246
03:03:49,340 --> 03:03:56,300
By using a switch party trick, it is possible to pass through a tile without triggering its event

247
03:03:56,960 --> 03:04:02,920
It requires to press X then Y immediately after, then change the leader

248
03:04:07,040 --> 03:04:11,040
Menu #20: Swap Locke and Sabin, Sabin gets Stray

249
03:04:12,540 --> 03:04:18,100
We passed through the tile that triggers the fight against Inferno

250
03:04:19,960 --> 03:04:25,980
Equipping an Esper on Sabin is to unlock his Magic command during battle

251
03:05:47,480 --> 03:05:50,280
Menu #21: Relm gets Ramuh

252
03:06:20,680 --> 03:06:27,400
This time we use the Goggle glitch with the X-Potion item, resulting in casting Bababreath

253
03:06:29,240 --> 03:06:33,860
This spell automatically ejects the target from the battle

254
03:07:01,640 --> 03:07:07,180
We used that time to put the Fire Shield on top of the inventory

255
03:07:22,140 --> 03:07:24,760
Menu #22: Cyan gets Maduin

256
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:16,420
We used twice the party switch trick to walk the conveyor belt backwards

257
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:22,180
This skips another boss (Poltergeist)

258
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:16,280
If we cast Bababreath on Kefka, it would trigger the second tier

259
03:11:17,440 --> 03:11:24,100
If one character is bababreathed, however, the game considered that the fight was not lost

260
03:11:25,840 --> 03:11:29,600
So it triggers the ending sequence

261
03:11:39,640 --> 03:11:42,740
The movie ends now
