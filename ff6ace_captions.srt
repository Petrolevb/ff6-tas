1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,780
This is a Tool-Assisted Speedrun created by Kadmony and Keylie

2
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,480
The final time is 31:47.69, using 11562 rerecords

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,220
You can visit tasvideos.org for more information

4
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,980
The route in this TAS is to execute arbitrary code using a glitched weapon attack

5
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,460
The Japanese version of the game features a glitch that allows you to equip any item in any slot

6
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,720
Simply put the item in the 256th slot, make sure you cannot equip any item in that slot, and select "Optimize"

7
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:11,280
When attacking with a glitched weapon, the game calls an incorrect routine for the attack animation

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:22,040
The routine we want to call is delivered by either the X-Ether, Charm Bangle, Czarina Ring or Gold Hairpin

9
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,240
All these items are only found in the late game (>_<)

10
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:36,080
However, using the sub-frame reset technique, we can gather them much quicker (^_^)

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,960
In this route, we will take an X-Ether from the Ancient Castle

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:57,140
We access the Ancient Castle by combining the map id of the Cave to the Sealed Gate (0186) and the Phantom Train (0092)

13
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,140
This gives id 0192 which is the cave to the Ancient Castle

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,860
We select Bio Blast with Terra for the next fight

15
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,880
Battle Speed 6 (slowest), Message Speed 1 (fastest) and cursor on memory

16
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,140
Having no window opened speeds up the fight ending

17
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,920
We need to win another fight so Terra reaches level 4

18
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,360
Opening a window freezes the enemy ATB (wait trick)

19
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,880
We use the escape to modify the RNG

20
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,780
The second group is the strongest

21
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,840
We don't need to unequip Mog's weapon this time

22
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,800
We save once in Narshe to keep the uninitialized World Map coordinates in memory

23
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,520
We will be using these coordinates to teleport elsewhere in the World Map

24
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,520
We open the menu here to store Y = 0x34 in the map coords

25
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,220
We enter again and this time store X = 0x18 in the map coords

26
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,640
We save and reset after overwriting X map coord

27
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,940
Now we have one savefile with X = 0x18 and Y = 0x34 (used later)

28
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,560
We save/reset after overwriting the world map coords

29
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,620
This transfers the uninitialized World Map coords to the save in the World Map

30
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,260
allowing us to reach any destination (but only once)

31
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,920
This time, we overwrite only the World Map X coord

32
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,940
Together with Narshe Y coord, this produces new coords

33
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,900
We buy Sprint Shoes and sell Locke's weapon

34
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,580
Again, overwriting only the X coord

35
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,740
This allows us to enter the Cave to the Sealed Gate

36
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,160
Grabbing Locke's Assassin weapon

37
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,840
It has a 1/4 chance of inflicting the Death status

38
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,020
You may notice we change the colors of the menu before doing any save/reset

39
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,080
This is to manipulate the save checksum, otherwise the save is considered as corrupted

40
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,980
We want to reach the savepoint here, because the map id is 0182

41
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,760
Together with the first savepoint of the Phantom Train (id 0092)

42
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:45,460
We can produce a new id 0192 which is the cave to the Ancient Castle

43
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,940
We also needed the previous coords setup in Narshe so that we appear there inbounds

44
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,520
We do a first save/reset to transfer Locke's weapon to the other savefile

45
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,440
And a second one to write the map id on the savefile with the right map coords

46
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,180
Next step is to recruit Sabin and Cyan

47
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,860
We need both of them to enter the Phantom Train

48
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,080
There are several ways to recruit both characters

49
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,760
We chose to do the whole Imperial Camp sequence

50
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,760
We will have a little help from Locke

51
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,380
Shadow's theme is not supposed to be played here btw

52
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,280
Because of our the game script is coded, we will keep Locke and Terra in the next fight

53
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,980
Well, let's use Locke weapon then

54
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,840
I wonder if the developers put a Death protection on Kefka

55
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,960
Nope

56
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,080
This saves a few seconds as it skips some dialogues

57
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,460
We equip the Black Belt on Locke and set Battle Speed on 1 (fastest)

58
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,480
We have Kuku in our team instead of Sabin

59
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:42,300
He is weak (level 2) but can still kill the soliders with a critical

60
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,680
Terra however cannot

61
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:15,000
MTek Armors are immune to Death so we cannot use Locke

62
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,660
Kuku is too weak to kill an MTek Armor himself

63
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,020
We will use a little shortcut with a save/reset

64
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,120
Now we can enter the Forest from the exit, which is much closer to the Train

65
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,180
The game would softlock here without both Sabin and Cyan

66
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,660
Save/reset to write the first byte of the map id

67
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:13,720
To be able to execute our custom code, we need to attack with the X-Ether at a specific frame of the fight

68
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,360
At frame 19025 exactly, which is after 5 minutes of fight

69
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,020
Thanks to the TAS convention, we only care about the last input

70
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:37,220
So we must find a way to make a character attack without any input

71
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,100
The solution we used is to get the character muddled

72
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,400
He will use a random command by himself

73
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:58,860
The enemy we want to fight is the Goblin, which can cast L.3 Muddle when alone

74
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:06,220
Locke is currently level 6, so he will be holding the X-Ether

75
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:18,080
In our custom code, we must take care of ending the fight without any input to do (no XP/Gold message)

76
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:31,020
Then we just have to manipulate the enemy to cast L.3 Muddle after 5 minutes while keeping Locke alive, with no input

77
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:41,080
This was easily the hardest part of the TAS, and it took more time than doing the rest of the TAS

78
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,000
We start to move Assassin at the bottom of the inventory

79
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,480
We want Cyan to equip that weapon, but he normally cannot

80
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:08,600
That's why we will use the equip glitch

81
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,100
Grabbing the X-Ether

82
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,760
We equip the Assassin on Cyan and give the shield to Locke

83
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,620
Now we move the X-Ether at the bottom of the inventory

84
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:41,140
We cannot do it in one fight, so we will need to finish from the menu (slower)

85
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:51,960
Moving the X-Ether down and selecting Optimize

86
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,380
Now the full code that triggers the ending is written with the window colors

87
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:06,920
If you are interested in the technical details, read the tasvideos submission text

88
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:25,400
We need to kill the two small enemies, because the remaining one has a different AI script when alone

89
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,720
With some wait trick, Cyan can kill both before they have a chance to attack

90
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,160
We queue some commands with Terra and Kuku to end input earlier

91
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,640
By selecting and deselecting a weapon, we cause lag in the RNG counter

92
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,260
This was the last input, so the TAS ends here!

93
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,300
Now enjoy 4 minutes of nothing

94
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:16,700
Our custom code that will be executed consists on:

95
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,120
1. Store the ending address in the event pointer

96
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,200
2. Set a flag to remove the ending softlock

97
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:40,240
This softlock happens when you trigger the ending without entering the World of Ruin

98
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:48,340
3. Fix the stack that has been corrupted by the glitch

99
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:56,740
4. Remove all enemies from the fight. It triggers the end of the fight

100
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,000
5. Remove the Death flag from the two dead enemies.

101
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:13,400
Otherwise we get XP/Gold messages that we would have to confirm manually

102
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:21,340
6. Return to the normal code execution

103
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,680
Still three minutes to go

104
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,360
We placed the shield in the first slot, so Locke attacks with it, then the X-Ether

105
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,960
End
